Clone the server down on your own computer. To do this, open up your terminal (make sure you have the git CLI installed) and run
### `git clone https://github.com/ehuntsman/nasa.git`

Once downloaded, run
### `npm i`
This will install all the dependencies. There aren't many, but it won't work unless you do this step.

Now the magic begins! Go ahead and run
### `npm start`
This will run the app in the development mode. Since you're just taking a gander and not posting it live, this is a good way to go.

Go to any web browser (except Internet Explorer, because you know you shouldn't be using that anyway) and got to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
